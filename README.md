murum generates wallpapers for your machine!

## Usage

## How it works

To put it simply, murum gets the album art for your recent listening history, figures out some canvas sizes, works out
(through the power of [fancy maths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_neighbor_interpolation)) where the art needs
to go and then sets your desktop to the result. Easy! Right?
